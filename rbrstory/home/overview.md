# System Overview #

Room By Room is a smart heating control system, comprising a central controller with user interface, heating elements - radiators or underfloor heating - in each room and thermometers to monitor temperatures.

An optimal heating system should have the following attributes:

 - Ability to control temperatures in each room independently
 - Easy to use
 - Simple to install
 - Its cost can be recovered quickly from the savings made by using it
 - Remote maintenance that can be delegated

Taking these in turn:

**Ability to control temperatures in each room independently**  
One of the biggest sources of heat wastage is in heating rooms that are not in use. Many people aim to turn off radiators in unused rooms, but in practice it becomes inconvenient to do so and too easy to forget. A good system allows control to be done from a smartphone, wherever you may be at the time. The system should offer a timing schedule for each room, allowing desired temperatures to be set for specified periods during the day, and profiles that vary according to the day of the week or weekend.

**Easy to use**  
The user interface should present informaiton clearly and simply without requiring any tehnical knowledge to operate. The main screen should present a clear view of the entire system, showing which rooms are being heated and when the next program change will occur. Room-specific functionality can be implemented with popup windows that open in response to taps on large buttons on the main screen.

**Simple to install**  
The system should require the minimum of electrical and plumbing work to install. electrical work is limited to running cables from power sockets to radiators, which will all have a small control box near them. Radiators will have to be already fitted with TRVs; if this is not already thecase then a plumber will be needed to change the valves.

**Its cost can be recovered quickly from the savings made by using it**  
It should be possible to save anything from 10% to 30% of annual heating cost by only heating rooms when they are needed. The saving in energy cost should cover the installation cost of the system within a couple of years.

**Remote maintenance that can be delegated**  
Not everyone is able to operate equipment of this type. Those with disabilities such as poor sight or mobility often cannot operate touchscreens, so someone else will have to look after the system. Remotely management is important, as is the ability of a carer or maintenance person to look after several systems. How this is done is up to those individuals or organisations; the system should provide all the features they may need.
